Refer to the [bird dataset](https://ericlind.github.io/data-mgmt-4-biologists/data/bird-data.xlsx) about
which your colleague asked for assistance. 

You decide to create a new data pipeline from scratch for the 2018
field season. Create a spreadsheet in Excel for data entry. 

Be sure to use the data validation criteria to prevent some of the
challenges you identified with the data earlier. The goal is 
to prevent obviously wrong values from being entered, and 
to create homogenous data columns. 

Some examples of things to try:

1. Year must be an integer with a value in the study period.
2. Site should be one of the WMAs.
3. Species should be one of the identified list.
4. Dates should be standardized, and units should be specified.
