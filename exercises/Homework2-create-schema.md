# Create a database schema

**Homework should be committed to your _github.umn.edu_ repository by 4:30 Monday March 19.**

You will work in the named repository (ENT5920-Lastname) you created in Week 3.

Use a dataset of your own, preferably one you will be using in your
research. If you do not have access to a dataset of your own, you can download the ... 

*Create a database schema* as follows. This is meant to be a visual and conceptual exercise.
You can use the MySQL workbench or
another GUI database designer, or slidemaker software like Powerpoint, or
draw it on a piece of paper and scan the file. Whichever method you 
use, be sure to clearly label the elements below. 

1. Normalize your data. Plan out tables and columns, such that
data are stored in one place, and related to other tables through common variables.

2. For each column, indicate a data type using the [MySQL specifications]({{ site.baseurl}}/materials/sql-data-types).

3. For each table, indicate which column(s) will be *Primary keys* and which 
columns will be *Foreign Keys*. For the Foreign Keys, indicate what table
and column(s) they are referencing. This can be done through a link, 
a drawn line, or in a table.

4. Save and commit the file (with a useful name) to your local git repository.

5. Push the changes to your remote (github.umn.edu) repository.

6. Ensure both Dan (dcarivea) and Eric (elind) are added as collaborators
to your repository.
