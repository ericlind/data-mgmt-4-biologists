Using the lakes dataset and `ggplot2`, create a bivariate 
scatterplot with algal species richness on the x axis and 
chlorophyll a on the y axis. 

Using the `shape` grouping argument in `aes()`, assign a different
shape to each lack in the scatterplot. 

What does this plot look like? 

What if anything does the message in the console say?

What might be a better way to plot this relationship for the
different lakes?
