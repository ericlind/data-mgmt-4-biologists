This is a follow up to
[Set Up Git]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Version-control-basic-set-up-git-R).

Copy the subdirectory folders you created as part of [Week 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Read-data-R).
This should include a `/data` subdirectory with a csv file, 
and a `/code` subdirectory with the script you used to read in the data.

Using the RStudio Git tab, commit these changes to version control 
with a good commit message. Then check to
see if you can see this commit in the history.

Finally, push your changes to your remote repository. Check to see
whether the commit appears in your github.umn.edu repo.
