#### Pairwise / Group Discussion:

1. Think about the research datasets you have (or will have). 
What *else* would you like to know about your species, 
your locations, your dates, your observations? 
Write down a few examples.

2. Where you would obtain the data you would like to have?

3. How would you *join* the data you obtain, to the data you 
already have? Try to be as specific as you can, 
thinking in terms of actual columns.
