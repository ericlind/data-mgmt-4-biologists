    * You don't learn how ride a bike just by listening to someone talk about it
      and the same is true for computing
* Reading before class
* I do, we do, you do
    * I will demo an idea using live coding
	* We will work on an associated exercise together in class
	* You will work on additional exercises on your own (both in & out of class)
* Peer instruction
    * Interact with each other during the we do and you do parts
	* You are at least as likely to learn from your peers as from us
	* Introduce yourself to one of your neighbors you don't know
