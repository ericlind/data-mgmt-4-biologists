## What does it mean to share data publicly?

#### Your data will be available for anyone, to do anything
[Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) means
open!  but... you have no claim to prevent anyone from altering your data,
no right to help with interpretation, or to deny someone from 
misusing your data.

#### Your data must be in an open format
* there are recommended formats, e.g. [Dryad recommended filetypes](http://datadryad.com/pages/filetypes)
* should be a *standard* format
* should be a *non-commercial* format
* should be a *human-readable* format where possible

#### Your data will be available consistently in perpetuity
* [Digital Object Identifier](https://www.doi.org/)
e.g., try searching "10.5061/dryad.6t94p" 

#### You should include
* data
* metadata
* code
* README and other documentation necessary to understand structure

## What are the main *reasons* to make your data publicly useable?

#### Group fitness
The broader research community, and the general public, can 
benefit from the most data available to answer a particular 
question of interest, especially those for which the data were 
*not* intended.

Reproducibility, a key topic (and a foundation of the trust
given to scientific results), is facilitated by data availability.

#### Individual fitness
* Grant money: many agencies requiring release, at least nominally
* [Altmetrics](https://www.altmetric.com/)
* Data Usage Index
* Data citation
* Fame, if not fortune...

But what about the impact of the shared data on your future
productivity? Will sharing data now make *you* "less productive,"
even if it makes the overall research community more productive?

## What are the main *places* to make your data publicly useable?
In general, the objectives are to have a stable, long-term
place for the data, as well as have the data be indexed and
citeable.

#### In conjunction with publication
* [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/pages/repository)
	- publishing [charges](https://datadryad.org/pages/payment) are $120 as of April 2018
	- embargo only with publisher's permission

#### Free-standing or in conjunction with work in progress
* [Figshare](https://figshare.com/account/login)
	- upload, get DOI, share (private or public)
	- embargo up to 2 years
	- CC By 4.0 or CC-0
	
* [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/deposit/new)
	- upload, get DOI, share (private or public)
	- CC By 4.0
	
* Github
	- e.g., [PortalData](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData)

* [Environmental Data Initiative](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/data/edi-data-policy/)
	- CC0
	- allows embargo and "offline" private sharing
	- archived & indexed by DataOne
	- [LTER data standard](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/browse.jsp)

* DIY data service
	- e.g., [Datasette](https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight-2628db9)
	- web or blog hosting
	- immediately useful, less traceable or citeable

* others: search [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/) for 
domain-specific registries


#### Archiving: for the long term

* Dryad + DataOne partnership
